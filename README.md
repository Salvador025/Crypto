## Description
### For this project we decided as a team to develop the ITESO cryptocurrency. This project was constantly monitored and validated to meet all the requirements that were assigned prior to the development of the software.
This is going to be a crypto coin for the ITESO, this project is going to be done in 2 parts. the first part is the blockchain and all the parts for the function of the coin. The second part is the wallet, the interface that the users are going to use to do the transactions of the coin.
